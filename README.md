# CRM

This report is an extension of an implementation of a data mining framework from the significant paper *An Efficient CRM-Data Mining Framework for the Prediction of Customer Behavior*, which proposed a framework that can predict customers’ decision on campaigns from financial institutions by building models on the given dataset. 

Two classification models were used for comparison in the study: 

* Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks 
* Naïve Bayes 

### Data Pre-process
The dataset analysis start by investigating the distribution of different attributes like:
* Age
* Occupation
* Bank savings 

Prediction of missing values and value imputation are performed to improve the framework’s design.

The model includes several classification algorithms:
* Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks
* Naïve Bayes 
* Support Vector Machine
* Decision Tree
* K-Nearest Neighbor. 


### Result Evaluation
The result was concluded by the performance and accuracy that **MLPNN** is better with **0.9 accuracy**. Since the conclusion from the study only considered accuracy for models’ performance, it cannot reveal the hidden knowledge of the dataset to build the best performing framework for CRM systems. This report explores more approaches to enhance this proposed framework to an extent.
